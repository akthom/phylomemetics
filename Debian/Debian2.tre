>Data file = Debian1.nex
>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
>  Starting seed = generated automatically
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 83
>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      2 characters are excluded
>      Of the remaining 83 included characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        7 characters are constant
>        3 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of (included) parsimony-informative characters = 73
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: simple (reference taxon = sid unstable)
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  100 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 0.02 sec (CPU time = 0.02 sec)
